# Ciphertext

---

Ciphertext is encrypted text transformed from plaintext using an encryption algorithm. Ciphertext can't be read until it has been converted into  plaintext (decrypted) with a key. The decryption cipher is an algorithm that transforms the ciphertext back into plaintext. The term cipher is sometimes used as a synonym for ciphertext. However, it refers to the method of encryption rather than the result.

**Types of ciphers**
There are various types of ciphers, including:

+ Substitution ciphers. Replace bits, characters, or character blocks in plaintext with alternate bits, characters or character blocks to produce ciphertext. A substitution cipher may be monoalphabetic or polyalphabetic:
  - A single alphabet is used to encrypt the entire plaintext message. For example, if the letter A is enciphered as the letter K, this will be the same for the entire message.
  - A more complex substitution using a mixed alphabet to encrypt each bit, character or character block of a plaintext message. For instance, the letter A may be encoded as the letter K for part of the message, but later it might be encoded as the letter W.
  
+ Transposition ciphers. Unlike substitution ciphers that replace letters with other letters, transposition ciphers keep the letters the same, but rearrange their order according to a specific algorithm. For instance, in a simple columnar transposition cipher, a message might be read horizontally but would be written vertically to produce the ciphertext.
